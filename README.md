# Project-Ideas
This are various project ideas that I had.


1. Automation 
- Slack Automation tool for SCRUM daily meetings to give a more structured way on Slack: Have a form when you should be able to fill in the progress and impediments. and mark yourself if you are blocked. Also this can be used to fill in time tracking tools.


2. Games 
- Variations on the Climbing game https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IvanAF.ClimbAMIYPfree. But only use buttons on the screen 4 buttons in total to control the climber's movement.
- Game about a lost kite that wants to return the child and have to go throught alll kind of levels to reach them. 
- Game about a jellyfish that wants to reach the surface of the ocean and needs to go throught all kinds of obstacles (veritcal scroller). Game play similar to flappybird
