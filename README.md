# Project-Ideas
This are various project ideas that I had.


1. Automation 
- Slack Automation tool for SCRUM daily meetings to give a more structured way on Slack: Have a form when you should be able to fill in the progress and impediments. and mark yourself if you are blocked. Also this can be used to fill in time tracking tools.
